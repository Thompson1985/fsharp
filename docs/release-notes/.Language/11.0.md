### Added

* Simplify implementation of interface hierarchies with equally named abstract slots: when a derived interface provides a Default Interface Member (DIM) implementation for a base interface slot, F# no longer requires explicit interface declarations for the DIM-covered slot. ([Language suggestion #1430](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/1430), [RFC FS-1336](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/pull/826), [PR #19241](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/19241))
* Support `#elif` preprocessor directive ([Language suggestion #1370](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/1370), [RFC FS-1334](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/main/RFCs/FS-1334-elif-preprocessor-directive.md), [PR #XXXXX](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/XXXXX))
